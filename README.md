## A simple Breakout Clone in Unity

This is a simple demo Breakout clone I created in Unity. Since this repository is publicly available all assets are either self made or freely licensed for public use. I will link to the orginal source with a readme.txt in the appropiate asset folder.

Play/Use at your own risk, you are free to copy any/all of the code.

There is no warranty this will work for you at all.
